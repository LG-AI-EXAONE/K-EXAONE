<tool_result>Summary:
The Forbes Wellness Trends Report 2025 by Angelina Villa-Clarke, published February 4, 2025, centers on smarter, tech-enabled longevity wellness and the integration of advanced science with traditional practices. It notes that longevity wellness is at the forefront of Preferred Hotels & Resorts’ Travel Trends predictions for 2025, highlighting biohacking, high-tech recovery, and brain-health initiatives across luxury properties. Examples include ZEM Wellness Clinic Altea in Spain (opened last month) with a ten-acre site featuring 95 suites and a 4,000 sqm spa, plus Europe’s first Metawell Centre; Alohilani Resort Waikiki Beach’s Fit Waikiki and Drip Hawaii IV lounge; and longevity-focused offerings at Lefay Resort & Spa Dolomiti and The Alpina Gstaad. The report also covers Accor’s Wellness Trends 2025, which stresses science-based, transparent wellness and a holistic approach. Additionally, brain fitness emerges as a major theme, with investments in brain-health services, nootropics, and tech-driven cognitive enhancement.

Answer to the question:
Preferred Hotels & Resorts Travel Trends predictions for 2025 identify longevity wellness as a leading trend, combining advanced science and technology with traditional wellness practices to support recovery, healthy aging, and mental well-being. The article provides concrete examples of how this trend is being enacted across luxury properties and destinations.

In concrete terms, ZEM Wellness Clinic Altea in Spain opened recently (the article states it “opened last month”) and is described as a pioneering medical clinic offering a blend of cutting-edge technology and traditional wellness. It sits on ten acres and includes 95 suites and a 4,000 square meter spa, with a Recovery Unit featuring cryotherapy, hyperbaric oxygen, and pressotherapy, and it showcases Europe’s first Metawell Centre developed by the Gharieni Group to deliver anti-inflammatory effects, improved sleep, detox and lymph drainage, and enhanced recovery.

The piece also highlights ongoing or upcoming longevity-focused experiences at other properties: Lefay Resort & Spa Dolomiti in Italy and The Alpina Gstaad in Switzerland, both part of the broader longevity-wellness menu; SIRO One Za’abeel in Dubai (focusing on hi-tech wellness) and a second SIRO property, SIRO Boka Palace in Montenegro, opening in May 2025 with a Destination Fitness pillar offering outdoor activities and recovery labs. In Waikiki, Alohilani Resort’s Fit Waikiki and the Drip Hawaii IV lounge illustrate hotel-based longevity and recovery services.

Brain fitness is underscored as a major trend within longevity wellness. Accor’s Wellness Trends report frames brain health as a rising priority in a longer-living population, with four market directions: brain supplements, nootropic-infused drinks, high-tech brain devices, and personalized brainwave programs. Viavi’s brain-health service, developed with Dr. Sabine Donnai, offers a comprehensive brain evaluation and personal health strategy for £12,000, plus a pTau blood test available for £1,000. The article also notes that brain-health initiatives are being integrated into wellness offerings more broadly, including services spearheaded by practitioners like Dr. Donnai and Viavi, in the context of a broader move toward science-backed, transparent wellness. Accor’s Emlyn Brown is quoted describing wellness in 2025 as grounded in science, authenticity, technology, trust, and sustainable, whole-self wellbeing.</tool_result><|endofturn|>
